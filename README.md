# Risk Analytics Case Study
## Problem Statement:
Credx is a leading credit card provider that gets thousands of credit card applicants every year. But in the past
few years, it has experienced an increase in credit loss due to increase in defaults. The CEO believes that the
best strategy to mitigate credit risk is to acquire "the right customers". 

##Objective:
The objective of the project is to help CredX identify the right customers using predictive models, which are built
using past data of the bankâ€™s applicants. We need to determine the factors affecting credit risk, create strategies
to mitigate the acquisition risk and assess the financial benefit of the project.
